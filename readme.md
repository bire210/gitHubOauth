To obtain the clientID and clientSecret for your GitHub OAuth application, you need to create a new OAuth application on GitHub. Here are the steps to obtain these values:

1. Log in to GitHub:

Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com/) and log in to your GitHub account.


2. Access Developer Settings:

Click on your profile picture in the top right corner to open the dropdown menu.
Select "Settings."

3. Navigate to Developer Settings:

In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings."


4. Create a New OAuth Application:

In the "Developer settings" page, click on "OAuth Apps" or "OAuth Developer Apps" (depending on the GitHub interface). This is where you'll manage your OAuth applications.


5. Register a New OAuth Application:

Click the "New OAuth App" or "Register a new OAuth application" button to create a new OAuth application.


6. Fill in Application Details:

You will be prompted to fill in details about your OAuth application, including the following:
Application name: Choose a name for your application.
Homepage URL: Enter the URL of your application's homepage.
Authorization callback URL: This is the URL where GitHub should redirect users after they authorize your application. For local development, you can use http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback. Make sure to update this URL for production.


7. Register the Application:

Click the "Register application" button to create your GitHub OAuth application.


8. Obtain clientID and clientSecret:

Once your application is registered, GitHub will provide you with the Client ID and Client Secret. These are the credentials you will use in your Node.js application for GitHub OAuth. Keep these values secure, as they are sensitive.


9. Update Your Node.js Application:

Replace 'your-github-client-id' and 'your-github-client-secret' in your Node.js application code with the actual Client ID and Client Secret obtained from GitHub.


After completing these steps, your Node.js application should be able to use the provided clientID and clientSecret to perform GitHub OAuth authentication.
